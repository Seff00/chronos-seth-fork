*** covariate study ***

correlation =/= feature importance.

flawed 1-shot experiment: 
covariate importance analysis 1 is a naïve way to measure feature importance,
only on one direct 7-days prediction, which could be particularly noisy or volatile,
and thus does not fully reflect the entire dataset. 
might be good to measure importance across various or longer time steps
perhaps a rolling prediction would better capture the true signal of each covariate.

other possible reasons why copper was a "better" covariate than oil:
- linearity of correlation calculations in EDA
- volatility from copper (vs smooth oil prices) might provide the model some signal for cotton
- spurious correlations

experiments:
1. univariate daily forecasting
2. univariate weekly forecasting
3. multivariate daily forecasting / direction
4. rolling 1 day vs direct full horizon prediction

5. LoRA
6. finetuning
