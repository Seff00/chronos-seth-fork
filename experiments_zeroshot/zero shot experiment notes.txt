*** covariate study ***

correlation =/= feature importance.

might be good to measure importance across various or longer time steps

the covariate importance analysis 1 is a naïve way to measure feature importance,
only on the latest 7 days, which could be noisy,
and thus does not fully reflect the entire dataset.




experiments:
1. univariate daily forecasting
2. univariate weekly forecasting
3. multivariate daily forecasting / direction
4. (to do) rolling 1 day vs direct full horizon prediction
