*** covariate study ***

correlation =/= feature importance.

flawed 1-shot experiment: 
covariate importance analysis 1 is a naïve way to measure feature importance,
only on one direct 7-days prediction, which could be particularly noisy or volatile,
and thus does not fully reflect the entire dataset. 
might be good to measure importance across various or longer time steps
perhaps a rolling prediction would better capture the true signal of each covariate.

other possible reasons why copper was a "better" covariate than oil:
- linearity of correlation calculations in EDA
- volatility from copper (vs smooth oil prices) might provide the model some signal for cotton
- spurious correlations

When you want to train on the latest data and test on the last 7 days (instead of first 7 days of a 1-year
  hold-out), you'll need to update:

  Files to Update:

  1. data_split.py (Line 61)

  # Current
  test_size = 365  # 1 year

  # Change to
  test_size = 7    # Last 7 days only

  2. forecast_direct.py (Line 32)

  # Current
  TEST_SET_SIZE = 365  # Hold-out test set is last 365 days (1 year)

  # Change to
  TEST_SET_SIZE = 7    # Hold-out test set is last 7 days

  3. train.py - NO CHANGES NEEDED
=========================================================================================================

experiments:
1. univariate daily forecasting
2. univariate weekly forecasting
3. multivariate daily forecasting / direction
4. rolling 1 day vs direct full horizon prediction
5. LoRA
[to do]
- predict returns (vs price) === with lora?
- predict copper price (vs cotton price as target) === with lora?
- full finetuning

to do edit plot: not outputting cotton features
